Load Simulation:

// Load Jobs complete and incomplete
// Load noflyzones
// Load retired drones
// Load hubs next, includes the following:
{
    // Refer to saved uid to buy and load batteries from assigned hub
    // Refer to saved uid to buy and load drones from assigned hub
    // Once everything is loaded, iterate through all objects to assign IDronesObject properties
    // Assign batteries to drones then jobs to drones 
	    // i.e. drone.AssignedBattery = battery & drone.AssignedJob = job
    // Assign drones to battery, Assign drones to job
}
// Assign completed jobs to drones and retired drones
